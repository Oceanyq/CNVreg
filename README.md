CNVreg solves association analysis for trait - Copy Number Variants (CNV) with penalized regression. It jointly regresses CNVs over a lage genomic region (e.g. a chromosome) and select important CNVs and set the coefficients of non-important CNVs as 0 while encouraging adjacent CNVs to share similar effect size.
